### 🔬 Research Interests

I have been working with deep learning since 2016, and I'm passionate about its applications in creative fields.
My main research interests include generative models, multimodal learning, and AI-assisted creativity.
During my Master's and PhD studies, I explored the task of text-guided image editing.

My ultimate goal is to work on removing the barriers to creativity through intelligent software to allow people to express their best creative selves.
